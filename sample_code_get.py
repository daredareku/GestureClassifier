However, I can give you some guidance on how to approach this task.

For the first task, you need to develop a model that can detect and classify hand gestures in an image. You can use the LeapGestRecog dataset to train your model. 
The dataset contains images of hand gestures captured using a Leap Motion Controller. It consists of 10 different hand gestures that are annotated with labels.

To train your model, you can use PyTorch, which is a popular deep learning framework. You can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to train your model. 
CNNs are well suited for image classification tasks. You can start with a simple architecture and gradually increase the complexity of the network to improve its performance.

Once you have trained your model, you can use it to classify hand gestures in an image. To do this, you need to preprocess the input image and feed it to your model. 
You can use OpenCV to capture images from a webcam and preprocess them before feeding them to your model.

Here's some sample code to get you started:
